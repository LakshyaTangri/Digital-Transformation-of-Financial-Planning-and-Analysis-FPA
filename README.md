Defination of Methodologies used in above cases:

Dispersion measures the spread of data points. Variance and standard deviation are common measures, quantifying overall volatility without distinguishing between upward and downward deviations. Other tools, such as skewness and kurtosis, can address this.

Simple Displays are graphical representations that help visualize data patterns and potential flaws. While useful for hypothesis formulation, they are not suitable for hypothesis testing.

Statistical Moments beyond the mean and variance provide additional insights into data distribution. The Jarque-Bera test assesses normality, which is often assumed in financial data but not always accurate.

Linear Correlation Analysis measures the linear relationship between two variables using the correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1.

Parameter Instability arises from the sensitivity of estimates to different data subsets. By examining how estimates change over time windows, we can quantify this instability.

Linear Regression models the relationship between an independent variable (X) and a dependent variable (Y) using a linear equation. It identifies the best-fitting line to explain the data.

Regression Model Instability occurs when the estimated coefficients are sensitive to changes in the data. Assumptions about the model, such as linearity and homoscedasticity, must be met to ensure accurate and reliable results.

Multiple Linear Regression extends linear regression to include multiple independent variables, allowing for the analysis of their relative contributions to the dependent variable.

Violations of Regression Assumptions can lead to biased, inconsistent, or inefficient parameter estimates. Common violations include non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, and multicollinearity.
